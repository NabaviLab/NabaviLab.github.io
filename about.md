Our research interest is on development of novel computational methods, based on statistical machine learning and signal/image processing techniques, to detect and integrate genomics, trancriptomics, and epigenomics (genomics) features. 

### Research Projects

The current active research project is on developing novel computational methods to identify candidate biomarkers of drug resistant in heterogeneous cancer such as ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer.
